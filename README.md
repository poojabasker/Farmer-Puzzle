# Farmer-Puzzle

## Problem Statement
<br>
A farmer lives on a small plot of land next to a river. One day, he travels across the river in a small boat and purchases a wolf, a sheep, and a box full of grass from a feed and supply store. When the farmer returns to his boat to cross the river again and go home, he realizes he has a dilemma.
<br>
The farmer can only take one item in his small boat at a time, otherwise he risks capsizing. He cannot leave the wolf alone with the sheep, because the wolf will eat the sheep. He cannot leave the sheep alone with the grass, because the sheep with eat the grass.
<br>
How does the farmer successfully get all three items across the river?
